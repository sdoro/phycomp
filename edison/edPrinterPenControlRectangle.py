#NOTE: due to the printer gearing, using 15cm as the input parameter in the drive function results in a ~4.5cm movement of the pen.

#For the rectangle program, start with the pen as close to the pen-control robot as possible. 

#Push 'play' on this robot AFTER you push 'play' on the paper-control Edison.
